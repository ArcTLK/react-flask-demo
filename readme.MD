### How to start?
When starting a new React application, the recommended way is to use the Create React App CLI tool. Of course, you'll be expected to have the latest versions of Node and Npm (which is included by default in the Node installer for Windows) from `https://nodejs.org/en/`.

To use the Create React App CLI, you can run the following command: `npx create-react-app react-demo`
Here, `react-demo` is the name of our application.

This operation creates a folder called `react-demo` wherever you ran this command. It also automatically runs `npm install` along with the required packages. Finally, it creates some other basic files so that you can directly try running the application and see if it works!

To run the application, first navigate to the new folder using: `cd react-demo`
Then, run: `npm start`

To start designing your application, you can wipe the content present in `./src/App.css` and `./src/App.js` and write your own code!
